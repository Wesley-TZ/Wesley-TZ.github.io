		<h2 class="center">General Analysis of the Reasons for the Comparatively Uncommon Use of AI in the Medical Field</h2>
		<h3  style="text-align:left">Wesley Wang</h3>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Abstract</h3>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>AI is not widely used in the medical field and hospitals now, factors like information leaks, lack of mental support, liability concerns and racial disparities might be contributing to this phenomenon. Inputting more data and upgrading the AI are possibly feasible solutions. </p>
		</div>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Current Application of AI in the Medical Field</h3>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>Currently, AI doesn’t have a strong presence in the medical field, but it is still being used in some cases and diagnoses. The most common roles for AI in medical systems are clinical decisions including multiple departments like cardiology and neurology, and imaging analysis.  </p>
		</div>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>“In cardiology, Artificial intelligence algorithms have shown promising results in accurately diagnosing and risk-stratifying patients with concern for coronary artery disease.” (Wikipedia, 2024) As for imaging analysis, especially in dermatology, compared to 86.6% diagnosis accuracy of skin cancer by dermatologists, AI achieved approximately 95% accuracy. </p>
		</div>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>Hitherto, AI has achieved superb results in accurate diagnosis in some medical areas, however, we seldom perceive the usage of AI in hospitals. Hence, there might be several factors contributing to this phenomenon. </p>
		</div>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Information Leaks</h3>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>In the 21st century, as internet technology gets more developed, most of the data are stored by the internet and electric devices, this is common in different formal hospitals. However, the convenience comes with risk. Information leaks have been one of the problems that cannot be neglected. On July 7th, 2020, it was found that approximately 2,600,000 medical records were accidentally leaked by an AI company, Cense AI, this information included customers’ names, medical insurance, payment records, etc. Possible information leaks caused by the uncertainty of AI might be one of the reasons for its uncommon use. </p>
		</div>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Lack fo Mental Support</h3>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>Cancer is one of the most fatal diseases in the world, an analysis of the data for the past 20 years shows that the prevalence of depression among cancer patients was estimated to be 27%. Moreover, the studies indicate the possibility of cancer patients committing suicide is 20% higher than those without cancer. It suggests that providing mental and social support is essential for nurses, doctors, and families during cancer patients’ rehabilitation. If AI replaces these roles, we are not certain if it can be responsible for giving suitable mental support to the patient, since AI gathers information from the Internet, and completes the commands, hence, numerous people doubt if AI is empathetic enough. </p>
		</div>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Liability Issues</h3>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>“In health care, where AI systems increasingly hold the potential to aid doctors in their medical decision-making, how might concerns around malpractice liability come into play?” (John Hopkins University, 2023) According to the research by Tinglong Dai and Shubhranshu Singh, John Hopkins Business School members, they conducted a model to explore physicians’ decision-making. The result shows that they prefer to use AI in low-uncertainty cases and avoid using AI when facing high-uncertainty cases. The research suggests that physicians opt not to use AI in the first place to avoid medical malpractices and latent liability issues. Physicians’ liable concerns indirectly caused the infrequent use of AI. </p>
		</div>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Bias and Disparities</h3>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>Race is a complex concept affecting health. According to research about asthma by NIH published in 2013, the rate of asthma found in US adolescents of different races is Puerto Rican Americans (13.1%), followed by African Americans (9.5%), whites (7.2%), and Mexican Americans (3.6%). The research attested that ethical/racial disparities do exist. Commonly, AI receives and then analyses the data of diseases and patients to make appropriate decisions, however, racial differences might cause an imbalance of data between different ethnicities, causing inaccurate diagnoses for minority communities and causing medical malpractices. </p>
		</div>
		<h3 style="text-align:left">Conclusion</h3>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>To sum up, because of the incomplete development of AI, and the demand for more data and examples of different diseases, AI is not widely used in the medical field to avoid medical malpractices and liability issues. As scientists and researchers delve into computer science and input more data to AI, it will be safe enough for common use in hospitals and help people inclusively. </p>
